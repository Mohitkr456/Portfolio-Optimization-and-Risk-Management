# Portfolio-Optimization-and-Risk-Management
This project delves into the critical aspects of portfolio diversification, optimization, and risk management. By constructing a well-diversified portfolio of 10 assets, the analysis aims to demonstrate the advantages of spreading investments across various asset classes.
A rigorous portfolio optimization process was employed to determine the optimal weights for each asset within the portfolio. This involved considering factors such as expected returns, risk, and correlations between assets. The optimized portfolio was then compared to a benchmark index and a single-security investment to assess its performance.

To gain a deeper understanding of the portfolio's risk exposure, the project utilized the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). By calculating beta coefficients for each asset, the analysis estimated their systematic risk relative to the market. These estimates were then used to assess the expected returns of individual assets and the overall portfolio.

The results of the analysis highlight the significant benefits of diversification. The diversified portfolio exhibited lower volatility and a more consistent return profile compared to the single-security investment. Additionally, the portfolio's risk exposure was effectively managed through the optimized asset allocation.

This project offers valuable insights for both individual investors and financial professionals. By understanding the principles of portfolio diversification, optimization, and risk management, investors can make informed decisions and potentially improve their investment outcomes. The analysis also provides a foundation for further research and exploration in the field of portfolio theory.
